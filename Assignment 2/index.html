            <p>You know I want you
               <br> It's not a secret I try to hide
               <br> I know you want me
               <br>So don't keep saying our hands are tied
               <br> You claim it's not in the cards
               <br> And fate is pulling you miles away
               <br>And out of reach from me
               <br>But you're here in my heart
               <br> So who can stop me if I decide that you're my <span class='high'>destiny?</span></p>

        <div class="highnote">
            <p>What if we <span class='high'>rewrite the stars?</span>
                <br> Say you were <span class='high'>made to be mine</span>
                <br> Nothing could <span class='high'>keep us apart</span>
                <br> You'd be the one I was meant to find
                <br>  It's up to you, and it's up to me
                <br>  No one can <span class='high'>say</span> what we get to be
                <br>  So why don't we <span class='high'>rewrite</span> the stars?
                <br>  <span class='high'>Maybe the world</span> could be ours, tonight</p>

                You think it's easy
                <br>  You think I don't want to run to you
                <br>  But there are mountains
                <br>  And there are doors that we can't walk through
                <br>  I know you're wondering why
                <br>  Because we're able to be just you and me, <span class='high'>within these walls</span>
                <br>  But when we <span class='high'>go outside</span>
                <br><span class='high'>You're gonna wake up and see that</span> it was hopeless after all

                <br>Everything <span class='high'>keeps us apart</span>
                <br> And I'm <span class='high'>not the one you were meant to find</span>
                <br>It's not up to you, it's not up to me
                <br> When everyone tells us what we can be
                <br> How can we <span class='high'>rewrite the stars?</span>
                <br> Say that the <span class='high'>world</span> can be ours, tonight
